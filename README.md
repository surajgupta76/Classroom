# Classroom
I have Developed a Backend project where I have created some REST API's using SpringBoot
Below is the Question: 


You are the class monitor and you want to maintain the structure of the classroom by making a simple spring boot application to perform basic CRUD operations. There are 3 ways to define the structure of the classroom:

Add a new student to the classroom.
Add a new teacher to the classroom.
Add a student-teacher pair denoting that the student is taught by given teacher
Requirements of the application:
Make an MVC architecture, with Student and Teacher as your only model classes, which will have some fields as their properties, constructors and getters-setters. Then make a controller, service and repository class with appropriate annotations. Since you want to keep it simple, you don’t need to use any database. (Hint: Think HashMap(s))

You need to implement the logic for following functionalities:

Add a Student: POST /students/add-student Pass the Student object as request body Return success message wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - addStudent

Add a teacher: POST /students/add-teacher Pass the Teacher object as request body Return success message wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - addTeacher

Pair an existing student and teacher: PUT /students/add-student-teacher-pair Pass student name and teacher name as request parameters Return success message wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - addStudentTeacherPair

Get Student by student name: GET /students/get-student-by-name/{name} Pass student name as path parameter Return Student object wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - getStudentByName

Get Teacher by teacher name: GET /students/get-teacher-by-name/{name} Pass teacher name as path parameter Return Teacher object wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - getTeacherByName

Get List of students name for a given teacher name: GET /students/get-students-by-teacher-name/{teacher} Pass teacher name as path parameter Return List of students name(List()) wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - getStudentsByTeacherName

Get List of all students added: GET /students/get-all-students No params or body required Return List of students name(List()) wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - getAllStudents

Delete a teacher and its students from the records: DELETE /students/delete-teacher-by-name Pass teacher’s name as request parameter Return success message wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - deleteTeacherByName

Delete all teachers and all students by them from the records: DELETE /students/delete-all-teachers No params or body required Return success message wrapped in a ResponseEntity object Controller Name - deleteAllTeachers

Please make the following classes and make sure you name them exactly as following:

StudentController.java
StudentService.java
StudentRepository.java
Student.java
Teacher.java
Note:

Use ResponseEntity object to return the required objects in the controllers
Make sure you follow the requirements for the controller very very carefully or your application will give compilation error while running against hidden test cases
Test all the APIs in postman before you submit.
